# AWS Config

AWS Config is a service which records the configuration of resources over time into configuration histories.

All of this information is stored regionally in an S3 configuration bucket.

AWS Config is capable of checking for compliance and generating notifications and events based on compliance.

It is NOT, however, capable of preventing changes from happening.
