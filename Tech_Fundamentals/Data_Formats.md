# Data Formats

## YAML

_YAML_ is a human readable data serialization language.

A YAML document is an unordered collection of key:value pairs.

Indentation is very important in YAML.

YAML files are commonly used for configuration such as with _CloudFormation_.

## JSON

_JSON_ is used within AWS as one of two CloudFormation template formats and for identity and resource policies.
