# Networking

According to [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OSI_model), the _Open Systems Interconnection model (OSI model)_ is a conceptual model that provides a common basis for the coordination of [ISO] standards development for the purpose of systems interconnection.

The 7 layers in the OSI model work together to collaboratively transmit data from one person to another across the globe.

## OSI Model Layer 1 (Physical)

Layer 1 (the lowest layer) of the OSI model focuses on the electrical and physical shared medium of devices.

This may include the layouts of pins, hubs, network adapters, etc.

This layer is responsible for containing information inside bits and transferring these individual bits from one node to the next.
