# Cloud Computing Fundamentals

## Cloud Characteristics

The 5 essential characteristics a system needs to be considered a cloud platform are:

- **On-Demand Self-Service** -- Can provision capabilities as needed without requiring human interaction.
- **Broad Network Access** -- Capabilities are available over the network and accessed through standard mechanisms.
- **Resource Pooling** -- -- There is a sense of location... no control or knowledge over the exact location of resources. Resources are pooled to serve multiple consumers using a multi-tenant model.
- **Rapid Elaticity** -- Capabilities can be elastically provisioned and released to scale rapidly outward and inward with demand. To the consumer, the capabilities available for provisioning often appear to be unlimited.
- **Measured Service** -- Resource usage can be monitored, controlled, reported, and billed.

## Types of Cloud

- **Public Cloud** -- Using 1 public cloud
- **Private Cloud** -- Using on-premises cloud
- **Multi-Cloud** -- Using more than 1 public cloud
- **Hybrid Cloud** -- Using public and private clouds
