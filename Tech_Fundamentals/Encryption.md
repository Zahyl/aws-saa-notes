# Encryption

**Encryption At Rest** -- Generally involves a single entity and is used to protect against physical theft.

**Encryption In Transit** -- Involves multiple individuals or systems and is used to protect data as it is transferred from one individual/system to another.

**Symmetric Encryption** -- Uses a single key that needs to be shared among the individuals/systems. It is an older technique that is fast but less secure.

**Asymmetric Encryption** -- Used a pair of keys; one public and one private to encrypt and decrypt messages while communicating. This is a more modern and secure technique but one that is also slower in terms of speed.
