# Route 53

_Amazon Route 53_ is highly available and scalable DNS web service.

It connects user requests to internet applications running on AWS or on-premises.

Route 53 operates as a global service which means we donâ€™t need to select a region when using it.

The data that Route 53 stores/manages is replicated between regions making the service globally resilient.

Overall, Route 53 can help us to:

1. Register domains
1. Host the zone for the domain and provide managed name servers
1. Route internet traffic to the resources for the domain
