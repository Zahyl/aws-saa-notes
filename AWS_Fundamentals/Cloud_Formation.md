# CloudFormation Basics

It can be tedious and time-consuming to manually setup resources in AWS.

Fortunately, _AWS CloudFormation_ is a service that helps us to deploy resources in a repeatable, testable, and auditable manner.

CloudFormation does this via the usage of template files (that can either be in YAML or JSON formats).

In essence, CloudFormation allows us to manage all of our infrastructure using code in the same way that we manage an applicationâ€™s functionality using code.

Apart from saving time and ensuring resources are deployed in a consistent fashion, CloudFormation can also be useful for promptly recreating infrastructure after a disaster.
