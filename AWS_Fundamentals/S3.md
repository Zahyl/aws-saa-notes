# Simple Storage Service (S3) Basics

S3 is a core AWS service that provides near infinitely scalable object storage that is accessible from anywhere with a public internet connection.

Data is stored as objects within resources called buckets.

Buckets have a flat structure and can hold an unlimited amount of objects. Each object can range in size from 0 bytes to 5 TB.

Bucket names must be globally unique. There is a soft limit of 100 buckets per account, and a hard limit of 1000 buckets.

An object consists of a key which is a name, and a value which is data.

S3 should be the default place to input/output data to AWS services/products, unless there are specific conditions that make others storage services such as EBS more suitable.
