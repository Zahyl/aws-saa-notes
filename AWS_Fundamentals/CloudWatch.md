# CloudWatch Basics

_Amazon CloudWatch_ is used for resource monitoring, events, and alerts.

CloudWatch provides metrics for every service in AWS.

Metrics are variables to monitor such as CPU utilization.

If the metric we’d like to monitor doesn’t yet exist it’s also possible for us to create it ourselves.

We can use metrics to trigger events or use them to create visualizations that can be viewed in the dashboard.
