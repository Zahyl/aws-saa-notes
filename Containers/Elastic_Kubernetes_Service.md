# Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS)

**Amazon EKS** is a managed Kubernetes service for running Kubernetes in the AWS cloud and on-premises data centers.

EKS can run on AWS, Outposts, EKS Anywhere, and EKS Distro.

When using EKS, the Kubernetes control plane and scaling is managed by AWS, and it runs on multiple AZs.

EKS integrates with other AWS services such as ECR, ELB, IAM, VPC, etc.
