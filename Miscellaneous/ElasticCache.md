# ElastiCache

ElastiCache is a managed in-memory cache which provides a managed implementation of the _redis_ or _memcached_ engines.

It’s useful for read-heavy workloads, scaling reads in a cost effective way, and allowing for externally hosted user session state.

It’s important to note that in order to integrate ElastiCache into an existing system, changes to the code of the application will be required.
