# CloudFormation Outputs

Templates can have an optional Outputs section.

Values declared in the Outputs section are accessible from a parent stack when using nesting, can be imported into other stacks (to create cross-stack references), returned in responses (to describe stack calls), and can be viewed in the CloudFormation console.
