StackSets are a feature of CloudFormation allowing infrastructure to be deployed and managed across multiple regions and multiple accounts from a single location.

Additionally, it adds a dynamic architecture â€” allowing automatic operations based on accounts being added or removed from the scope of a StackSet.
