# DeletionPolicy

We can define the `DeletionPolicy` attribute on any or all of our resources to indicate whether we want our resource deleted, retained, or have a snapshot taken when the corresponding logical resource or stack is deleted.

It is important to note, however, that not all resources support retaining or having snapshots taken.
