# CloudFormation Mappings

CloudFormation Templates can contain a Mappings object. This Mappings object can contain many mappings.

We can use the `FN::FindInMap` intrinsic function to help us retrieve values from within the map.

Overall, CloudFormation Mappings can be used to help us improve template portability.
