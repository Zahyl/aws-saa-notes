# Database Migration Service

DMS is a managed database migration and replication service for moving databases both into and out of AWS quickly, securely, with minimal downtime, and with zero data loss.

DMS supports MySQL, Aurora, Microsoft SQL, MariaDB, MongoDB, PostgreSQL, Oracle, Azure SQL, etc.

When using DMS, at least one of the two databases (source and/or target) must be within AWS.

## Schema Conversion Tool

SCT is used when converting one database engine to another. SCT is NOT used when migrating between databases of the same type.
