# Amazon MQ

Amazon MQ is an open-source message broker that is an AWS implementation of Apache Active MQ.

It supports open standards such as JMS, AMQP, MQTT, OpenWrite, and STOMP.

Amazon MQ provides both queues and topics.

Unlike Amazon SNS and SQS, Amazon MQ is NOT a public service. Itâ€™s VPC based and requires private networking.
