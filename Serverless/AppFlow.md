# Amazon AppFlow

AppFlow is a fully managed integration service that enables us to securely transfer data between Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) applications like Salesforce, SAP, Zendesk, Slack, ServiceNow etc., and AWS services like Amazon S3 and Amazon Redshift in just a few clicks.

Using AppFlow allows us to run data flows at an enterprise scale at chosen frequencies: on a schedule, in response to a business event, or on demand.

Itâ€™s also possible to configure data transformation capabilities such as filtering and validation to generate rich, ready-to-use data as part of the flow itself, without additional steps.

AppFlow automatically encrypts data in motion, and also allows users to restrict data from flowing over the public Internet for SaaS applications that are integrated with AWS PrivateLink. This is useful because it reduces exposure to security threats.
