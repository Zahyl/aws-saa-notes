# Amazon Cognito

Amazon Cognito is a core identity product inside of AWS that assists with authentication, authorization, and user management for web/mobile apps.

A _user pool_ is a user directory in Amazon Cognito. With a user pool, users can sign in to our web or mobile app through Amazon Cognito.

Users can also sign in through social identity providers like Google, Facebook, Amazon, Apple, or SAML identity providers.

Amazon Cognito _identity pools_ enable us to create unique identities for our users and federate them with identity providers.

With identity pools, we can obtain temporary, limited-privilege AWS credentials to access other AWS services.
