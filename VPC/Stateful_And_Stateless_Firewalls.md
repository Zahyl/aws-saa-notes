# Stateful Vs Stateless Firewalls

## Stateless Firewalls

Stateless firewalls require two rules per connection (1 IN, 1 OUT).

Stateless firewalls are an older technology that require more admin overhead, but they do come with the benefit of being able to better control both sides of traffic flow.

## Stateful Firewall

Stateful firewalls are intelligent enough to identify the REQUEST and RESPONSE components of a connection as being related.

With stateful firewalls, allowing a request generally means that the response will be automatically allowed as well.

Stateful firewalls are a modern technology that require less admin overhead.
