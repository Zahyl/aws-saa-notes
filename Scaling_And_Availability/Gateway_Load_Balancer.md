# Gateway Load Balancers

Gateway Load Balancers are used to help run and scale 3rd party appliances such as firewalls, and intrusion detection/prevention systems.

Gateway Load Balancers run on the third layer of the OSI model.

Route tables are used to customize traffic to and from a Gateway Load Balancer endpoint.

GWLBs use the GENEVE provolone to tunnel traffic and metadata.
