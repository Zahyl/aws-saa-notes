# Instance Store Volumes

Instance stores provide temporary block-level storage for our instances. This storage is located on disks that are physically attached to the host computer.

Instance stores are ideal for temporary storage of information that changes frequently such as buffers, caches, scratch data, etc.

Instance stores offer the highest storage performance in AWS and they are included in the instance price. It is important to note, however, that to use instance stores they must be attached at launch â€” they cannot be attached afterwards.
