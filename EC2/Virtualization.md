# Virtualization

Virtualization is the process of running more than one OS on a single piece of hardware.

Virtualization utilizes virtual software that mimics the functions of physical hardware in order to run multiple virtual machines simultaneously on a single device.

Virtualization can help businesses to use their hardware resources more efficiently, thus getting greater returns on their investments.

Another benefit of virtualization is that it helps us to manage our servers using software tools. We can create deployment and configuration programs to define virtual machine templates.

This can help us to easily duplicate our infrastructure when necessary and avoid error-prone manual configurations.

Virtualization can also aid in helping us to more quickly recover from disasters.

This is because replacing or fixing a physical server may take hours or even days, while fixing a virtualized environment can usually be accomplished in minutes.
