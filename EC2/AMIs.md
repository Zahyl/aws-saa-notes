# Amazon Machine Images (AMI)

AMIs are images provides by AWS that provide the information needed to launch an EC2 instance.

By default, an Amazon provided AMI is used. It is possible for us to create our own custom AMIs or use community/marketplace AMIs, however.

We can use a single AMI to launch multiple instances with the same configuration. Otherwise, if we require instances with different configurations we can use multiple AMIs.

An AMI includes:

- One or more Amazon EBS snapshots, or, for instance-store-backed AMIs, a template for the root volume of the instance (for example, an operating system, an application server, and applications).
- Launch permissions that control which AWS accounts can use the AMI to launch instances.
- A block device mapping that specifies the volumes to attach to the instance when itâ€™s launched.

AMIs are created in one region, and they only work in that specific region. Within that region, however, they can be used to deploy EC2 instances in any availability zone.

AMIs cannot be edited. The closest alternative is to use an AMI to launch an instance, update the configuration, and then make a new AMI based on the new configuration.

AMIs can be copied between regions. AMIs are not free, because costs are generated by the EBS snapshots that the AMI references.
