# CloudTrail

AWS CloudTrail monitors and records account activity across our AWS infrastructure.

This can help us to detect developer misconfigurations and malicious actors.

Some of the logged information includes the

**Where** -- Source IP Address

**When** -- EventTime

**Who** -- User, UserAgent

**What** -- Region, Resource, Action

It's important to note that CloudTrail is NOT a real-time service.

It often takes several minutes for account activity to appear in CloudTrail.
