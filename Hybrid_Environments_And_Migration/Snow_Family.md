# Snowball, Snowball Edge & Snowmobiles

These are three parts of the same product family designed to allow the physical transfer of data between business locations and AWS.

## Snowball

A 50TB or 80TB device ordered from AWS. It tends to be economical to use this device when we need 10TB-10PB of data transferred.

Multiple Snowball devices can be sent to multiple premises.

Snowball devices contain only storage, and NOT compute.

## Snowball Edge

Snowball Edge comes with both storage and compute capacities.

Ideal for remove sites or where data processing on ingestion is needed.

## Snowmobile

Portable datacenter within a shipping container on a truck.

Ideal for a single location when 10PB+ is required.

Itâ€™s generally not economical for multi-sites, or sub 10PB.
