# IPSec VPN Fundamentals

IPSec is a group of protocols used to set up encrypted connections between devices.

You can think of it as setting up secure tunnels across otherwise insecure networks.

Ipsec keeps data sent over public networks secure and is often used to set up VPNs.

It works by encrypting IP packets along with authenticating the source where the packets come from.
