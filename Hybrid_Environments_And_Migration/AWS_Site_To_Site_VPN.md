# AWS Site-to-Site VPN

AWS Site-to-Site VPN is a hardware VPN solution which creates a highly available IPSec VPN between an AWS VPN and an external network such as a traditional on-premises network.

VPNs are quicker to setup than Direct Connect and encrypt data in transit, but they don’t offer the same high performance.

AWS Site-to-Site VPN can be fully highly available if designed and implemented correctly.

The AWS “speed limit” for VPNs is 1.25GB per second throughput.
