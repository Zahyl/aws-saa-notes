# AWS Direct Connect

AWS Direct Connect links our internal network to an AWS Direct Connect location over a standard Ethernet fiber-optic cable.

One end of the cable is connected to our router, while the other is connected to an AWS Direct Connect router.

This physical connection can be 1, 10, or even 100GB per second (at the time of this writing).

Direct Connect (DX) Locations are not owned by AWS, AWS simply has space and equipment there.

AWS Regions typically have multiple DX locations, and they are usually located in major data centers in metro areas.
